# Task 7

Add functionalities to the to-do buttons

In this tasks, add functionality to the three buttons of the to-dos.

- The delete button must delete the to-do using `.destory`, and redirects to the profile page again.
- The edit button must create an input field and a submit button for the respective to-do and redirects to the profile page again which can be indicated by toggling the `edit` attribute for that particular to-do in the table. This input field and button can be used to change the value of current to-do and redirect to the profile page again after toggling the `edit` attribute again.
- The done button will mark the to-do as done, which can be indicated by changing some styling of the to-do, such as changing the color of its background. This can be indicated by toggling the `done` attribute in the table for that particular to-do.
