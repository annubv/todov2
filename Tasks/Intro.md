# TO-DO APP

In the following tasks, you'll be building a responsive to-do app.

Which will include following features:

- Ability to Signin / Signup.
- Ability for users to create, edit and delete their to-dos.
- Ability to Signout.

Your app must open the signin page if the user is not signed-in, from there, he/she can either sign in, or choose to open the sign-up page from where an account can be created.
After signining in or up, the user will be shown the profile page on which he/she can manage the to-dos.
If the user opens the homepage, sign-in page or sign-up page again, he/she will be redirected to his/her profile page.
To sign-in again, the user will be required to sign out first.

For this, you'll be required to store the signed-in user session using `express-sessions`
