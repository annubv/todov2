# Task 5

Complete the signin and signup forms

In this tasks, you need to complete the forms which you created earlier for the signin and signup page.

Both the pages must redirect to profile page on `/` when a post request is made by the buttons on these respective pages.
The pages must pass the relevant information to the profile page which will be required to show to-dos of that specific user.
For the testcases to work, make an ID with name: Led Zeppelin, email: led@zeppelin.com and password: stairwaytoheaven and try to sign in.  
You will create the profile page in the later task, meanwhile leave it blank.

Hint:

- Use sessions to pass the `id` and other info of the signed-in user to the profile page, which could be used to display the user's details.
